# SafeScape

By Pranati Modumudi, Varshini Sitarama, Danielle Egan

How might college students and local citizens be enabled to find safer walking routes based on areas of recent crime and verbal harassment so that they are more comfortable traveling alone?

Introducing SafeScape, an application to help you feel safer while traveling or walking alone. Our data-based model finds the safest route between point A and point B based on recent crime and verbal harassment data as well as community-input data. Our application learns your typical routes and identifies the best path way automatically. 

Our platform is built based on the Google Maps API and a similar algorithm to Waze.

## Features included
- Incorporates the Google Maps User Interface
- Identifies the userâ€™s current location
- Allows them to input their destination goal
- Displays the different possible routes to the user's destination
- Marks different spots (crime locations) on the map interface using an outside data source (currently from Kaggle)

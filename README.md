# SafeScape

### By Pranati Modumudi, Varshini Sitarama, Danielle Egan through the IND ENG 190E Course @ UC Berkeley

How might college students and local citizens be enabled to find safer walking routes based on areas of recent crime and verbal harassment so that they are more comfortable traveling alone?

Introducing SafeScape, an application to help you feel safer while traveling or walking alone. Our data-based model finds the safest route between point A and point B based on recent crime and verbal harassment data as well as community-input data. Our application learns your typical routes and identifies the best path way automatically. 

Our platform is built based on the Google Maps API and a similar algorithm to Waze.

## Features currently included
- Incorporates the Google Maps User Interface
- Identifies the userâ€™s current location
- Allows them to input their destination goal
- Displays the different possible routes to the user's destination
- Marks different spots (crime locations) on the map interface using an outside data source (currently from Kaggle)

## Files included
1. map.html 
  - includes the html code for the features listed above with the help of the Google Maps API
2. crime_data.json
  - contains crime information from San Francsico; collected from Kaggle
3. analysis.ipynb
  - includes initial data analysis, cleaning, and a short intro to the recommendation model of the crime dataset

## Future Path
Currently, our code is still undergoing bugging and addition processes and is not complete for stand-on use. We aim to continue working on our features to release a beta product soon. Some features that we expect to be incorporating in the future are an establish application user interface compatible with Android and iOS, security buttons, access to the user's emergency contacts, and many more. 

Stay on the lookout for our product and thank you for supporting us!
